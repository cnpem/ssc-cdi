Sirius Scientific Computing (*SSC*) Group codes for Coherent Diffractive Imaging.
The ``ssc-cdi`` package currently performs Ptycography and Ptycho-tomography reconstructions. 
Some examples are provided to ease the initial use. Enjoy!

Codes and public prototypes are being increasingly included within this project,
as long as they are tested and developed by the Scientific Computing Group.  

The ``ssc-cdi`` package source code is available in `zenodo website <https://zenodo.org/>`_ under the 
DOI: `10.5281/zenodo.13693177 <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13693177>`_.

For further information on the ``ssc-cdi`` package, visit the `website <https://gcc.lnls.br/wiki/docs/ssc-cdi/>`_ 
(needs to be inside the CNPEM network to access the website).
