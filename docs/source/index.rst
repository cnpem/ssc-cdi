Sirius Scientific Computing Group codes for Coherent Diffractive Imaging.

The **ssc-cdi** package currently performs Ptycography and Ptycho-tomography reconstructions. These are intended mostly to serve the Cateretê and Carnaúba beamlines at SIRIUS. 

The ptychographic reconsutruction codes in CUDA were developed by Giovanni Baraldi (former group member). The high-level Python modules were developed by the other authors below.
